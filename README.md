# Micrograd Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a simple autograd engine and neural network, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's "micrograd" project.

## Overview
The project is a lightweight autograd engine that supports backpropagation and neural network implementation.

## Features
- **Autograd Engine:** Implements custom backpropagation for scalar computations.
- **Basic Neural Network:** Includes simple feedforward layers with tanh activation.
- **Gradient Descent:** Updates parameters using backpropagation.
- **Visualization:** Uses `graphviz` for computational graph visualization.

## File Structure
- `micrograd1.ipynb`: Main implementation of autograd and neural network.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
